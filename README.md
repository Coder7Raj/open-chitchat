# 📖 Description

OpenChitChat is a full-stack real-time messaging platform designed with scalability, security, and modern development practices in mind.

The application combines Firebase Authentication for user identity verification with JWT-based session management using HTTP-only cookies for secure authentication. Real-time communication is powered by Socket.IO, while Cloudinary handles image storage and delivery.

The project follows a clean client-server architecture that separates authentication, API services, database operations, and real-time communication, making it suitable for learning production-level MERN application development.
